## Grading Policies

I want everyone receiving a passing grade in this course to be, at least, minimally competent in the course learning outcomes and for that to be reflected in your course grade. Traditional grading schemes do a poor job of indicating competency.

As an example, imagine a course with two major learning outcomes: X and Y. It is widely considered that a course grade of C indicates that a student is minimally competent in achieving the course outcomes. However, if the student were to receive a grade of 100 for outcome X, and a grade of 40 for outcome Y, the student would still have a 70 (C-) average for the course. Yet the student is clearly not competent in outcome Y.

Therefore the grading in this course will be handled in a different manner:

* All assignments will be graded on an ***Acceptable***/***Not Acceptable*** basis, based on whether the student work meets the instructor-supplied specification. 
* A minimum collection of assignments, indicating competency in the course learning outcomes, must be completed in an ***Acceptable*** manner to earn a passing course grade (D).
* Higher passing grades (A, B, C) can be earned by completing more assignments and/or assignments that show higher-level thinking and learning skills.

### Assignment Grading

* All assignments in this course will be graded exclusively on an ***Acceptable***/***Not Acceptable*** basis. 
* **For each assignment, you will be given a detailed specification explaining what is required for the work to be considered *Acceptable* (passing).** 
* Failing to meet *any part* of the specification will result in the work being *Not Acceptable* (failing). 
* There will be no partial credit given. 
* If you are unclear on what the specification requires, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
* It will be possible to drop a limited number of assignments with *Not Acceptable* grades (see *Tokens* below).
* It will be possible to revise and resubmit a limited number of assignments with *Not Acceptable* grades (see *Revision and Resubmission of Work* below).

### Course Grade Determination

Your grade for the course will be determined by which assignments and/or how many assignments you complete in an acceptable manner.

#### Base Grade

Assignment | Earn Base Grade<br>A | Earn Base Grade<br>B | Earn Base Grade<br>C | Earn Base Grade<br>D 
--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
Attendance and Participation<br>&nbsp;(out of 24 classes) | 23 | 22 | 21 | 20
Assignments<br>&nbsp;(out of *n* assignments, where *n* &#8776; 8) |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Base Assignment |  *n* | *n* | *n*  | *n* - 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Intermediate "Add-On" |  5 | 3 | 1 | 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Advanced "Add-On" | 2 | 1 |  | 
Self-Directed Professional Development Blog Entries<br>&nbsp;(out of 14 weeks) | 9 | 7 | 5 | 3

* **Failing to meet the all the requirements for a particular letter grade will result in not earning that grade.** For example, even if you complete all other requirements for a B grade, but fail to write 8 acceptable "Self-Directed Reading Blog Entries", you will earn a C grade.
* **Failing to meet the all the requirements for earning a D grade will result in a failing grade for the course.**

#### Plus or Minus Grade Modifiers

* You will have a ***minus*** modifier applied to your base grade if the average of your exam grades is 75% or lower.
* You will have a ***plus*** modifier applied to your base grade if the average of your exam grades is 85% or higher.
* Each unused token remaining at the end of the semester can be used to increase the exam average by 2 percentage points.

*Note: WSU has no A+ grade.*

## Attendance and Participation
* For class sessions with a specific lab assignment, you are expected to work on the assigned laboratory material within your group. Every member of the group is expected to contribute. The group is expected to complete the lab assignment or make substantial progress toward the completion of the lab assignment. If you complete the assigned material before the end of class you must show the instructor before leaving.
* For class sessions with no specific lab assignment, you are expected to be paying attention, participating in the class discussion, and asking questions.
* Arriving late and leaving early (unless you have finished and shown your work to the instructor) will result in your work being considered "Not Acceptable" for that lab session.
* Working on things that are not part of the work for this class during class time will result in your work being considered "Not Acceptable" for that lab session.

*A more complete specification for "Acceptable" (passing) attendance will be given during the semester.*

## Assignments
The assignments will give you a chance to apply the material to larger tasks. The assignments will vary in what you will be asked to do - programming projects, written assignments, analysis, etc.

### Base Assignment
Every assignment will have a *base assignment* portion that must be completed for the assignment to be considered "Acceptable". This will generally involve developing tests, determining suitable test inputs, and/or determining suitable test paths.

* Anyone working to earn a grade of C or higher must submit "Acceptable" work for **all** Base Assignments.
*  Anyone working to earn a grade of D or higher must submit "Acceptable" work for **all but one** of the Base Assignments.

*A more complete specification for an "Acceptable" (passing) Base Assignment will be given during with each assignment.*

### Intermediate "Add-On"
Each assignment will also have an *Intermediate Add-On* portion can be completed for anyone working for a course grade of C or higher. This will involve more detailed analysis of the developed tests, test inputs, and/or test paths.

* Differing numbers of Intermediate "Add-Ons" are required for different passing grades of C or higher. See the table under *Course Grade Determination*.

*A more complete specification for "Acceptable" (passing) Intermediate "Add-Ons" will be given during with each assignment.*

### Advanced "Add-On"
Each assignment will also have an *Advanced Add-On* portion can be completed for anyone working for a course grade of B or higher. This will involve even more detailed analysis of the developed tests, test inputs, and/or test paths.

* Differing numbers of Advanced "Add-Ons" are required for different passing grades of B or higher. See the table under *Course Grade Determination*.

*A more complete specification for "Acceptable" (passing) Advanced "Add-Ons" will be given during with each assignment.*

## Exams
We will have a midterm exam and a final exam.

The midterm is tentively scheduled to be given during class during the week of 15 October 2018.

Final project presentations will be given during our scheduled final exam periods of:

* Section 01 (M/W 8:00-9:15am) &mdash; Wednesday, 12 December 2018 &mdash; 8:30-11:30am
* Section 02 (M/W 3:30-4:45pm) &mdash; Wednesday, 19 December 2018 &mdash; 8:00-11:00am

## Self-Directed Professional Development Blog
Two of the CS Program-Level Student Learning Outcomes that this course addresses are:

> * Learn new models, techniques, and technologies as they emerge and appreciate the necessity of such continuing professional development. (Mastery)
> * Communicate effectively both in written and oral form. (Mastery)

You will be required to read outside blogs, articles, and/or books; listen to podcasts, etc. on your own and keep a blog about those items that you found useful/interesting. Your blog must be publicly accessible[^1], and will be aggregated on the [CS@Worcester Blog](http://cs.worcester.edu/blog/).

* Differing numbers of blog entries are required for different passing grades. See the table under *Course Grade Determination*.
    * I will only accept one blog entry per week. **You cannot wait until the end of the semester and then turn in all of your blog entries.** 

[^1]: If there is a reason why your name cannot be publicly associated with this course, you may blog under a pseudonym. You must see me to discuss the details, but your blog must still be publicly accessible and aggregated, and you must inform me of your pseudonym.

## Deliverables
All work will be submitted electronically through a variety of tools. The due date and time will be given on the assignment. The submission date and time will be determined by the submission timestamp of the tool used.

**Please do not submit assignments to me via email.** It is difficult for me to keep track of them and I often fail to remember that they are in my mailbox when it comes time to grade the assignment.

## Late Submissions
Late work will not be accepted. (See *Tokens* below.)

## Revision and Resubmission of Work

### For Assignments
If you receive a "Not Acceptable" on any portion of an Assignment (Base, Intermediate Add-On, or Advanced Add-On) you may revise and resubmit the assignment ***one time only*** without the use of a token.

* You must have submitted the original assignment on time, (or one day late with the use of a token.)
* You must submit your revision within one week from the date when the "Not Acceptable" grade and comments were posted in My Grades. (You may use a token to submit the revision one day late.)
* You may ask me for clarification of the assignment, or of the comments I made on your submission.
* You may ask me to look at your revised solution to see if it addresses my comments.
* If you address all the comments in an acceptable fashion, your grade will be converted to "Acceptable".
* You must let me know by email when you resubmit the assignment, so that I know to regrade it.

### For Self-Directed Professional Development Blog Entries.
You may revise and resubmit the ***first*** blog entry on which you receive a "Not Acceptable" without the use of a token.

* You must have submitted the original blog entry on time, (or one day late with the use of a token.)
* You must submit your revision within one week from the date when the "Not Acceptable" grade and comments were posted in My Grades. (You may use a token to submit the revision one day late.)
* You may ask me for clarification of the comments I made on your blog entry.
* You may ask me to look at your revised blog entry to see if it addresses my comments.
* If you address all the comments in an acceptable fashion, your grade will be converted to "Acceptable".
* You must let me know by email when you have posted the revised blog entry (with the URL to the revised blog entry), so that I know to regrade it.

## Tokens
Each student will be able to earn up to 5 tokens in the first week. These tokens will be earned by completing simple set-up and housekeeping tasks for the course.

Each token can be used to:

* replace a single missed class session (up to a maximum of 3 missed class sessions)
* turn in an assignment late by 24 hours
* turn in a second blog entry in an a single week
* revise and resubmit an assignment (up to a maximum of 2) that was judged "not acceptable". Any work to be revised and resubmitted must have been submitted by the original due date. 

### Token Accounting
* Unused tokens will be kept track of in the Blackboard *My Grades* area.
* Tokens will not be automatically applied. You must explicitly tell me **by email** when you want to use a token, and for which assignment.

## Getting Help
If you are struggling with the material or a project please see me as soon as possible. Often a few minutes of individual attention is all that is needed to get you back on track.

By all means, try to work out the material on your own, but ask for help when you cannot do that in a reasonable amount of time. The longer you wait to ask for help, the harder it will be to catch up. 

**Asking for help or coming to see me during office hours is not bothering or annoying me. I am here to help you understand the material and be successful in the course.**

## Contacting Me
You may contact me by email (Karl.Wurst@worcester.edu), telephone (+1-508-929-8728), or see me in my office. My office hours are listed on the schedule on my web page ([http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/]()) or you may make an appointment for a mutually convenient time.

**If you email me, please include “[CS-443]” in the subject line, so that my email program can correctly file your email and ensure that your message does not get buried in my general mailbox.**

**If you email me from an account other than your Worcester State email, please be sure that your name appears somewhere in the email, so that I know who I am communicating with.** 

<span title="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1795"><a href=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1795><img src=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd042215s.gif alt="Cartoon with bad examples of how to send email to your instructor."></a></span>

You may expect that I will get back to you within 24 hours of your email or phone call (with the exception of weekends and holidays), although you will likely hear from me much sooner.

## Code of Conduct/Classroom Civility

## Student Responsibilities 

* Contribute to a class atmosphere conducive to learning for everyone by asking/answering questions, participating in class discussions. Don’t just lurk!
* When working with a partner, participate actively. Don't let your partner do all the work - you won't learn anything that way.
* Seek help when necessary
* Start assignments as soon as they are posted.  Do not wait until the due date to seek help/to do the assignments
* Make use of the academic success center (see below)
* Expect to spend at least 9 hours of work per week on classwork.
* Each student is responsible for the contents of the textbook readings, handouts, and homework assignments.

## Accessibility Statement

To find out more information about the Writing Center including the Center’s hours and the Center’s Online Writing Lab, visit their website at [www.worcester.edu/writing]()

## Worcester State Library
For research help, go to the Library! The [Worcester State University Library] (http://www.worcester.edu/library), located on the second and third floors of the Learning Resource Center, provides access to print materials and items on course reserve in addition to a wide variety of full-text online resources accessible both on- and off-campus, including e-books, journal articles, newspapers, and magazines. Articles and book chapters not available in full-text through the Library’s resources can be obtained through Interlibrary Loan (ILL). With a little planning, ILL expands your ability to get credible sources about topics you pursue in your coursework. Additionally, as a member library of the [ARC consortium](http://www.worcesterarc.org), WSU students can also access resources at other college libraries.

The librarians at WSU can help you develop research questions, identify research strategies, search for relevant and reliable information and data, select the best sources for your paper or project, and cite that information. A librarian can visit your class, meet with you in person (one-on-one or in groups), and provide assistance via email, phone, or chat. While every WSU Librarian is able to help students with a project in any discipline, each department has a designated librarian to support the research needs of the students in that department. You are welcome to stop by their office, or make an appointment! [http://libguides.worcester.edu/askus](http://libguides.worcester.edu/askus)

## Academic Conduct
Each student is responsible for the contents of the readings, discussions, class materials, textbook and handouts. All work must be done independently unless assigned as a group project. You may discuss assignments and materials with other students, but you should never share answers or files. **Everything that you turn in must be your own original work, unless specified otherwise in the assignment.**

Students may help each other understand the programming language and the development environment but students may not discuss actual solutions, design or implementation, to their programming assignments before they are submitted or share code or help each other debug their programming assignments. The assignments are the primary means used to teach the techniques and principles of computer programming; only by completing the programs individually will students receive the full benefit of the assignments. If you are looking at each other’s code before you submit your own, you are in violation of this policy. 

Students may not use solutions to assignments from any textbooks other than the text assigned for the course, or from any person other than the instructor, or from any Internet site, or from any other source not specifically allowed by the instructor. If a student copies code from an unauthorized source and submits it as a solution to an assignment, the student will receive a 0 for that assignment.

**Any inappropriate sharing of work or use of another's work without attribution will result in a grade of zero on that assignment for all parties involved. If you do so a second time, you will receive an “E” for the course.**

Academic integrity is an essential component of a Worcester State education. Education is both the acquisition of knowledge and the development of skills that lead to further intellectual development. Faculty are expected to follow strict principles of intellectual honesty in their own scholarship; students are held to the same standard. Only by doing their own work can students gain the knowledge, skills, confidence and self-worth that come from earned success; only by learning how to gather information, to integrate it and to communicate it effectively, to identify an idea and follow it to its logical conclusion can they develop the habits of mind characteristic of educated citizens. Taking shortcuts to higher or easier grades results in a Worcester State experience that is intellectually bankrupt.

Academic integrity is important to the integrity of the Worcester State community as a whole. If Worcester State awards degrees to students who have not truly earned them, a reputation for dishonesty and incompetence will follow all of our graduates. Violators cheat their classmates out of deserved rewards and recognition. Academic dishonesty debases the institution and demeans the degree from that institution.  

It is in the interest of students, faculty, and administrators to recognize the importance of academic integrity and to ensure that academic standards at Worcester State remain strong. Only by maintaining high standards of academic honesty can we protect the value of the educational process and the credibility of the institution and its graduates in the larger community.

**You should familiarize yourself with Worcester State College’s Academic Honesty policy. The policy outlines what constitutes academic dishonesty, what sanctions may be imposed and the procedure for appealing a decision. The complete Academic Honesty Policy appears at: [http://www.worcester.edu/Academic-Policies/](http://www.worcester.edu/Academic-Policies/)**

**If you have a serious problem that prevents you from finishing an assignment on time, contact me and we'll come up with a solution.**

## Student Work Retention Policy
It is my policy to securely dispose of student work one calendar year after grades have been submitted for a course.
